Lets say you have a folder or specific file that you only want a user, or a group of users to have access to, how do we do this? we'll it is very simple!  <br/>

<br />
<br />
To begin, select the file and folder you want to grant or deny permissions for and right click it, choosing "properties" for example, i am going to choose my folder called "secret" on the desktop.    <br/>

<br />
<br />
After that, head to the security tab, this is where you can choose what specific users or groups have access to specific files and their permissions, such as being able to change the name of a file, or modifying its contents completely. Click the edit button next to "to change permissions"  <br/>

<br />
<br />
This will open the advanced security section of said file or folder. Click on the add button and a text box will show up at the bottom titled "enter the objects names to select" type the name of the user or group you wish to use to set permissions with. I will type in a group i made called "Level 3" click ok when you're done. <br/>

<br />
<br />
You will then be able to set the permissions of said user or group below. By checking full control, you allow the user or group to have administrator permissions over said file or folder, you can use this to add a specific user or group and click "deny" on the checkbox "full control" for example to deny that user or group from accessing secure files!  <br/>

<br />
<br />
In this example, i have given the group "Level 3" full control over the secret folder, and the specific user "Recardo" is denied every permission possible, meaning they will not be able to access this folder anymore. <br/>
